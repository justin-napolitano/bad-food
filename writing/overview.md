I've always believed that understanding the food we eat is crucial for our health and overall well-being. That’s why I embarked on this journey with my GitHub repo, **Bad Food**. This project isn't just about coding or building some fancy app; it's a personal reflection on my food habits and the choices we all make that impact our lives.

## Why Bad Food Exists

We all have those food habits we regret. You know, the late-night snacking or the endless soda refills. The purpose of this project is simple: to identify those "bad foods" and consciously make better choices. I wanted to document my understanding of these habits and reflect on how they affect not just my health but also my lifestyle. 

I realized the need for a space where I could not only jot down my thoughts but categorize them meaningfully. This project is my way of sharing insights that might resonate with others facing similar challenges.

## Key Design Decisions

This repository's design is straightforward. I opted for a **Markdown-based** approach, which allows for easy editing and readability. The idea is to keep things simple and accessible. Here’s why:

- **Non-Technical Focus**: Since this project isn't aimed at developers looking for a beefy application, there's no need for complex programming languages or frameworks.
- **Easy Access**: Anyone can clone the repo and read my reflections, thanks to the straightforward Markdown files.
  
## Features

The **Bad Food** repository includes several key elements that illustrate my reflections on eating habits:

- **Personal Reflections**: I write candidly about my unhealthy food habits and the lessons learned.
- **Categorization**: I’ve categorized various "bad foods" based on their health impacts, dental effects, and lifestyle considerations.
- **Insight into Moderation**: I share thoughts on how to incorporate moderation in food choices, aiming for a healthier lifestyle without feeling deprived.

## Tech Stack

Let’s be real; there’s not much tech wizardry here. The stack is minimal:

- **Markdown files**: All content lives in Markdown format. It’s clean, simple, and perfect for showcasing my reflections without the clutter.

## Project Structure

The structure of the repo is intentionally kept minimal:

```
/index.md    # Main content file with my reflections
/images/     # (Assumed) folder for possible images
README.md    # Overview of the project and purpose
```

Everything is organized for easy navigation, and **index.md** serves as the main go-to document. If you want to dive into my journey, that’s where you’ll want to start.

## Getting Started

For anyone curious to check out the repo, here's a quick starter guide:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/bad-food.git
cd bad-food
# Open index.md in your favorite markdown viewer or editor
```

This will pull the entire repo to your local machine, where you can read through my insights at your leisure. 

## Tradeoffs Made

While I wanted to keep this project minimalist, there are some tradeoffs I pondered before diving in:

- **No Interactive Features**: I could have gone the route of creating a web app with forms to submit reflections, but that wasn’t the focus. I wanted this to be a straightforward journal, not a software product.
- **Limited Media**: I didn’t initially include images or rich media elements because I wanted the focus on text. But that’s something I've been thinking about.

## Future Work / Roadmap

Looking ahead, there are several enhancements I'd like to implement:

- **Expand Content**: I want to delve deeper into categories like "Meat" and others. What does that really mean for our health?
- **Dietary Guidelines**: It would be valuable to outline more detailed dietary guidelines or personal goals that could serve as a roadmap for healthier choices.
- **Web Format**: Turning this into a full-fledged blog or simple website might improve accessibility for those who prefer reading in that format.
- **Visual Elements**: Adding images and other media could bring more richness to my reflections and enhance engagement. 

## Stay Connected

I love sharing updates about my projects and food journey on social media. If you’re interested in following along, find me on ***Mastodon***, ***Bluesky***, and ***Twitter/X***. 

## Conclusion

The **Bad Food** project is a personal exploration of what we eat and how it affects us. It's all about reflection, categorization, and growth. I see this as a living document — one that I hope will resonate with others and possibly spark conversations about our food habits.
