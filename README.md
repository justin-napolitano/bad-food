# Bad Food

A personal reflection project by Justin Napolitano focused on identifying and letting go of "bad food" habits. This repository contains thoughtful insights and categories around food choices that impact health, teeth, and lifestyle.

## Features

- Personal reflections on unhealthy food habits
- Categorization of "bad food" based on health, dental impact, and other criteria
- Insight into lifestyle changes and moderation

## Tech Stack

This project is primarily a markdown-based personal journal/reflection. It does not use any specific programming language or framework.

## Getting Started

Since this repository contains markdown content only, you can view it directly on GitHub or clone it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/bad-food.git
cd bad-food
# Open index.md in your favorite markdown viewer or editor
```

## Project Structure

```
/index.md    # Main content file containing the reflections and notes
/images/     # (Assumed) folder for images referenced in the markdown
```

## Future Work / Roadmap

- Expand on the "Meat" section and other categories
- Add more detailed dietary guidelines or personal goals
- Possibly convert reflections into a blog or website for easier reading
- Include images and media to enrich the content
