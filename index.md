# Bad Food: A Technical Reflection on Dietary Habits

## Motivation

This project is a personal journal that documents an individual's attempt to identify and reduce consumption of what they consider "bad food." The motivation is rooted in health concerns, dental preservation, and lifestyle choices. It serves as a structured reflection rather than a conventional software project.

## Problem Statement

Many people struggle with defining and managing unhealthy eating habits. This project tackles the problem by categorizing "bad food" through personal criteria such as health impact, dental harm, and economic considerations. It aims to provide clarity and accountability for dietary decisions.

## Project Construction

The project is implemented entirely in markdown, with no programming language or framework involved. The main content resides in `index.md`, which contains detailed reflections, categorizations, and personal narratives. Images are referenced but stored externally in an assumed `/images/` directory.

The repository structure is minimal:

- `index.md`: The core document with structured sections on different food categories.
- `README.md`: Documentation and project overview.
- `/images/`: Folder for media assets referenced in the markdown.

## Implementation Details

- The content is organized using markdown headings to separate themes such as "Unhealthy," "Harmful to My Teeth," and "Meat."
- Lists and sublists are used to itemize specific foods and behaviors.
- The project uses front matter metadata in `index.md` (title, author, tags, date, categories, series) which suggests it may be intended for use with a static site generator or personal knowledge management system.
- The reflections include both qualitative assessments and personal history, which provide context for the dietary choices.

## Practical Considerations

- This project is not a software application but a personal knowledge base.
- The markdown format ensures portability and ease of editing.
- Future enhancements could involve converting the markdown content into a blog or website for easier consumption and sharing.
- The content can be extended with more detailed dietary guidelines or goals, which may require additional structuring or tooling.

## Summary

This repository exemplifies a minimalist approach to documenting complex personal behavior through simple, structured text files. It prioritizes clarity and self-accountability over technical complexity. Returning to this project requires understanding the markdown structure and the personal context encoded within the reflections.
