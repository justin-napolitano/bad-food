# Reflections on "Bad Food": Why I'm Letting Go and What It Means

Hey there, I'm Justin Napolitano, and today I want to share some personal thoughts and reflections that I've been documenting in my project "Bad Food." This isn't your typical software repo—it's a deeply personal exploration of my relationship with food, health, and lifestyle choices.

## Motivation

I've always been fascinated by how what we eat shapes not just our physical health but our mental well-being too. Over time, I realized I had some habits around food that weren't serving me well—things I now call "bad food." This project is my way of putting those thoughts into words, reflecting on why I want to let go of certain foods, and setting intentions for healthier living.

## The Problem I'm Addressing

Food can be complicated. What counts as "bad" or "unhealthy" is often subjective and culturally influenced. For me, bad food includes things that are unhealthy, harmful to my teeth, overly expensive, or simply idolized without good reason. I wanted to unpack these categories and be honest with myself about what I consume and why.

## How It's Built

This project lives as a markdown file (`index.md`) in a GitHub repository. It’s a journal of sorts, where I write down my thoughts, categorize my food choices, and reflect on my habits. The markdown format lets me keep things simple, portable, and easy to update. I also tag the content with categories like "reflection" and "letting go," and include images to complement the text.

## Interesting Implementation Details

- I break down "bad food" into clear categories such as Unhealthy, Harmful to My Teeth, Meat, and others.
- Within Unhealthy, I list specific things to avoid like excess salt, sugar, saturated fat, and calories.
- I share personal stories, like how soda damaged my teeth and how I quit ice cream after a period of heavy running.
- The tone is honest and self-reflective, acknowledging cultural and generational backgrounds that influenced my habits.

## Why this project matters for my career

While this might seem like a purely personal project, it actually reflects important skills and values that are relevant to my career as a developer and thinker:

- **Clarity of Thought:** Writing clearly about complex, personal topics helps me communicate better in professional settings.
- **Self-Improvement:** Just like debugging code, reflecting on habits and iterating on them is key to growth.
- **Documentation Practice:** Keeping well-structured markdown notes is a transferable skill for any software project.
- **Empathy and Perspective:** Understanding personal and cultural context helps me build more thoughtful, user-centered software.

Thanks for reading along! If you’re interested in personal projects that blend lifestyle and reflection, or just want to see something different on GitHub, check out the repo. Maybe it’ll inspire you to think about your own "bad food" or habits you want to let go of.
